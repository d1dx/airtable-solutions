### Option 2: Use with ChatGPT

1. Copy the Python script code
2. Paste into ChatGPT with instructions: "Run this code and return the result as a .txt file (not as text, since it will be too long)"
3. Provide necessary parameters when ChatGPT asks
4. Download the generated formula file
5. Copy formula into Airtable and adjust field references
